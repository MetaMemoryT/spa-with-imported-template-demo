A demonstration of a [SPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) with page logic imported from template files.

Original idea extended from: https://www.polymer-project.org/articles/spa.html
and: https://github.com/Polymer/docs/blob/master/articles/demos/spa/final.html

# Purpose
Retain the advantages of a SPA (no page reloads), while organizing application functionality into separate files.

# Features
- deep linking
- navigation with keys
- page logic in separate files
- No need for compilation while developing
